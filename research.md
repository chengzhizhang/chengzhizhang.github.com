##  **Knowledge Entity Extraction and Evaluation**

### Using the Full-text Content of Academic Articles to Identify and Evaluate Algorithm Entities in the Domain of Natural Language Processing

Taking NLP as an example, we manually annotate the more algorithm entities with specific names in academic papers, and evaluate the influence of the algorithm based on the number of papers mentioning an algorithm and duration of mention. We analyze the changes of the algorithms with high impact in different years, and explore the evolution of the algorithm influence over time. Algorithm entities and sentences mentioning these algorithms identified by this work can be used as a training corpus for automatic extraction of the algorithmic entities.

##  **Social Media Mining** 
### Joint Modeling of Characters, Words, and Conversation Contexts for Microblog Keyphrase Extraction 
<img src="./keyphrase_extraction/framework.jpg" alt="Microblog Keyphrase Extraction" align="left" width="70%"/>
We propose a neural keyphrase extraction framework for microblog posts. The framework consists of two modules: a conversation context encoder and a keyphrase tagger. Conversation context encoders are utilized to encode conversation
context to help keyphrase taggers indicate salient phrases. The keyphrase tagger is employed to extract keyphrases from target posts. To leverage the structure of conversation, the hierarchical encoder is employed to learn the word-level and message-level information from a conversation context. To alleviate the OOV problem in usergenerated content on social media platforms, we utilized the character-level word embedding to capture both characterlevel and word-level features in both conversation context encoders and keyphrase taggers.
