* Taking the natural language processing (NLP) as an example, we manually annotate the more algorithm entities with specific names in academic papers, and evaluate the influence of the algorithm based on the number of papers mentioning an algorithm and duration of mention.
* We analyze the changes of the algorithms with high impact in different years, and explore the evolution of the algorithm influence over time.
* Algorithm entities and sentences mentioning these algorithms identified by this work can be used as a training corpus for automatic extraction of the algorithmic entities.
